# espLamp

little project to try out some esp8266's.
I've used a couple of nodemcu boards, connnected a bunch of ws2812 led strips to them.

this little sketch is meant to setup a wifi portal to connect them into the main wifi.
also setup a connection to a mqtt broker.

Once that's done, mqtt can be setup on a raspberry pi and add homekit support.
